# Deep Learning Reference Stack

This provides the Deep Learning Reference Stack. To offer more flexibility, there are multiple versions of the Deep Learning Reference Stack:
* Eigen optimized for Intel Architecture  
* Intel® Math Kernel Library for Deep Neural Networks (Intel® MKL-DNN) primitives
* PyTorch
* PyTorch with Intel® Math Kernel Library
* PyTorch with Intel® Math Kernel Library for Deep Neural Networks (Intel® MKL-DNN) primitives

Please see the folders in this level about the variants and how to build and use them.
